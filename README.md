# Security Evaluation of Android Devices

## Project Description
This is a 3 staged project on security evaluation of Android Devices. It consists of a system that evaluates a security score of android devices. This security score is calculated based on several parameters of an android device. There are two implementations of this software viz. a desktop app and an android app.

### Part-1
This part consists of a research paper that proposes the general idea of the project. It specifies different parameters that are used and the probability assigned to it.

### Part-2
This is a fuzzy implementation of the project idea. A desktop app is created for this purpose. Different parameter values must be manually entered to obtain a final security score.

### Part-3
In this part, a machine learning based mobile app is developed to get a security score. It uses a small feedforward neural network. The dataset required for it is manually generated. The different parameters required for calculating score are automatically retrieved by the app. This app is device agnostic and works only on android devices.
